The power and cooling data are in the power and cooling directory.
Data are organized by category and then by metric within a category.
Each data file contains data for one metric and one trial of the
experiment.  There are three trials in this experiment.

The application and system level data for each trial are in the
trial directories: t1, t2, t3.  Each trial directory is organized as follows:

   input/    the input files to run the application

   output/
      perfTrackData_2011-05-05T12:25:43/  -- the build and run files generated
                    PerfTrack.
      siosi6_HD_A1_HD_t*.sys.out -- the report generated by the 
                    application; timing information is at the very bottom.
      sysmpi-parsed/  -- contains one file per MPI rank and one summary file. 
          The per-rank files are named like this:

               nwchem-siosi6_224p-8ppn_NWICE-A1_HDfull_t01.sysmpi.77.cg

               The experiment is described by the first part:

                  nwchem-siosi6_224p-8ppn_NWICE-A1_HDfull_t01.sysmpi

               The application is "nwchem-siosi6".

               The configuration parameters are described by "224p-8ppn_NWICE-A1":
                  224 MPI processes (ranks)
                  With 8 processes per node
                  On the machine NWICE
                  On nodes contained in Rack A1

               "HDfull" is a short name that desribes how we packed the processes
                onto the machine (HD means High Density, Full means we used all nodes
                in the rack)

               The trial is "t01", the first trial.

               "sysmpi" refers to the tool used to collect the data.

               "77" in this example means MPI rank number 77.

               The final extension is meaningless.

          Each per-rank file contains MPI function call times for each MPI 
          function called by the MPI rank.  The format is this:
          MPI_FUNCTION_NAME STARTTIME ENDTIME TOTALTIME_IN_SECONDS

          The summary report ends with the following extension: sysmpi.rpt
          This file presents a summary report of the MPI function call data
          and the interrupt data.  Function call timings are given in seconds,
          and interrupts are given in counts.

The machine data (the meta data that describes each machine) is not here.  To look
at this data, you will need to view the PTDF machine data.
