The power and cooling data are in the power and cooling directory.
Data are organized by category and then by metric within a category.
Each data file contains data for one metric and one trial of the
experiment.  There are three trials in this experiment.

The application and system level data for each trial are in the
trial directories: t1, t2, t3.  Each trial directory is organized as follows:

   input/    the input files to run the application

   output/
      io-parsed/ -- a report that contains per-rank-per-device read and write
                    counts.  If more than one MPI rank shared a node, then only
                    data is presented for one of the ranks.
      perfTrackData_2011-05-05T12:25:43/  -- the build and run files generated
                    PerfTrack.
      siosi6_IO-BASIC_A1_even_t1.sys.out -- the report generated by the 
                    application; timing information is at the very bottom.
      sysmpi-parsed/  -- contains one file per MPI rank and one summary file. 
          The per-rank files are named like this:

               nwchem-siosi6_56p-2ppn_NWICE-A1_LDeven-IO-BASIC-improvedInstr_t03.sysmpi.49.cg

               The experiment is described by the first part:
               nwchem-siosi6_56p-2ppn_NWICE-A1_LDeven-IO-BASIC-improvedInstr 

               The trial is "t03", the third trial.

               sysmpi refers to the tool used to collect the data.

               "49" in this example means MPI rank number 49.

               The final extension is meaningless.

          Each per-rank file contains MPI function call times for each MPI 
          function called by the MPI rank.  The format is this:
          MPI_FUNCTION_NAME STARTTIME ENDTIME TOTALTIME_IN_SECONDS

          The summary report ends with the following extension: sysmpi.rpt
          This file presents a summary report of the MPI function call data
          and the interrupt data.  Function call timings are given in seconds,
          and interrupts are given in counts.


The machine data (the meta data that describes each machine) is not here.  To look
at this data, you will need to view the PTDF machine data.
