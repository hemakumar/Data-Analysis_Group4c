This project is done as a group effort as part of the course Operating System CS533 at Portland State University.
The Report of the project which explains the details aabout the course can be accessed at the following link:

There are two approaches followed for this analysis: 

1. Using Perftrack: Perftrack is a tool used for data analysis and provides us with a number of features which can be used for analyzing huge ammount of data.
More information can be found at the following url:
http://perftrack.cs.pdx.edu/

We have modified it further and tried t incorporate clustering into perftrack by lcoupling ELKI into it. We have also used python scripts to parse the outpu files for perftrack, The python scripts can be accessed at;
https://github.com/hemakumar/Data-Analysis_Group4c/tree/master/Perftrack_ELKI

2.The second approach we have used is to make custom scripts is haskell and incorporated it with ELKI. We also couple it get automated reports.
The custom scripts can be accessed at the following url:
